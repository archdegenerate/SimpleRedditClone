      "Content": "This is a message from the instigator of the bedbug epidemic in Paris: (the following text is a translation from a French forum) \u0022But what is my goal you ask? Why do that, oh big mad bug? Well, that\u0027s where the stroke of genius arrives. My interest is twofold. The first is that I hate, I hate France from the bottom of my guts and I hate the people who live here for the most part, I want this country to collapse as quickly as possible. I calculated that I have already cost more than 1 BILLION EUROS ALONE. And that\u0027s only taking into account the costs of treating bedbugs (which in practice is impossible, I\u0027ll tell you right away, it will always come back, don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s dead). And without counting the costs linked to psychological problems, loss of motivation, efficiency, lack of sleep, possible work accidents which may have occurred thanks to this etc etc. The second is that obviously knowing that bedbug infestations will increase I can not only ruin France, the state as well as individuals but also make as much money as possible by knowing which boxes to invest in and in which sector of activity exactly. The bedbug market is a growing market, very buoyant, I estimate it at more than 1000 billion units this year and double that next year with the return of tourism.\u0022 (this was shamelessly stolen from twitter.com, opinions are not my own)",
